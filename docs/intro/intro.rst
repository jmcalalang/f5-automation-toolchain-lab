This class is focused on the F5 Automation Toolchain and has been created to introduce students to the components and their uses. You should have a basic understanding of BIG-IP technologies and a desire to learn about automation and orchestration.

Composable infrastructure provides the mechanism to create reusable items, with small reusable items we can create more frequent changes gaining better agility and controlled fault domains.
