Module |labmodule|\, Lab \ |labnum|\: 99 Test Balloons Part 2
=============================================================

Exercise Part 2:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How can we improve our product? How can we improve our process?

- Defining acceptance criteria is not the same as writing tests, only to be applied after something is produced. They can be used as requirements, as tests, and as a target for developers.

- Automating acceptance tests (or executable requirements) can be very useful, as demonstrated by the test harnesses produced during the game.

- The investment in creating and automating acceptance tests is worthwhile and has a high return.
